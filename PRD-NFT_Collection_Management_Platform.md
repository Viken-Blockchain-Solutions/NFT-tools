## Introduction

The NFT Collection Management Platform is a web application that allows users to register, manage their NFT collections, and access transaction history based on their roles (admin, artist, and company). The platform will utilize modern technologies such as Next.js, TypeScript, JWT, MetaMask, ethers.js, and Alchemy API to provide a secure and user-friendly experience.

<br />
<br />

2. Provide role-based access for admin, artist, and company roles.
3. Integrate with MetaMask and other web3 wallets for seamless wallet connection.
4. Utilize ethers.js and Alchemy API to read and interact with the Ethereum blockchain.
